Brave Adventurer! You have traversed the perils of the Quantum Temple and stolen the Scrolls of Entanglement, but now your true challenge lies ahead. As you begin reading the ancient scrolls, you hear the crash of a gate behind you. Whirling, you see your way blocked by hard stone.

Luckily, you never leave home without your trusty operators, and you quickly set to work; it wouldn't do for the creature you've heard prowling the lower levels to catch you now...
